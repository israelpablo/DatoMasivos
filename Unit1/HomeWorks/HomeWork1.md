## What is Pair Coding?
When talking about pair coding, it is about proposing teamwork with two people.
These two people provide ideas and segments to the project, while one provides a part of the code, the other makes another part of the code, this makes the project in which they work much more practical than carrying out a project alone.
There are many reasons that make pair coding very usable, shown below.
Some of them.

### Produce better solutions:
As I mentioned before, better products are generated by working together since the project is enriched with the ideas of 2 people, since it would already be a shared idea.
### Share insights and context on the go:
Not being just one person, many times the fact of having another person allows the knowledge of one to another to expand since one may have a better way of developing a certain part of the project.
### Mutual learning and skill development:
Learning is something very important for which being 2 people this becomes more evident, the knowledge that can be obtained is much greater than working alone.

Last but not least, we must remember that when working in pairs, it is necessary to understand that you should not monopolize since this will not enrich our project, and allowing the other to participate will allow you to have a better perspective of the objective to be achieved.

### What is Pair Conding?

It is a programming practice that is only carried out on a single PC, in the same place, it is carried out by two people, one of whom is programmed and the other is supervised what is done, they are called by the name of "Programmer" to him what program and by "Navigator" to whom he supervises, this type of programming is used to have an agile development of software and is more correct, it is said that the type of role that the people who are worked, the roles are constantly changed so that there is more agility and different points of view and both people contribute equally, in the same way the person whose turn it is to be programmed will have to be commenting aloud on what is being done, and if solutions or proposals for the work and the other colleague must analyze these comments to see if it is correct or what can be changed or added and thus have a good job.
